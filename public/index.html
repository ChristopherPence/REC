<!-- This is the landin page for users that would log onto the REC webpage. This webpage, like all others in the REC project,
allows the user to travel to other pages through the multi-page navbar (which allows the user to easily traverse the REC website).
The user will also be able to see the latest of RPI news/current events. These events are pulled from the RRS feed, and are submitted
by clubs that are affiliated with the website.-->
