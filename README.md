How to use our project name in a sentence:
- "Have you checked the REC for that new club event?" - RPI Student
- "REC is so cool! I can see all of the flyers from my dorm room" - Another RPI Student

Why we chose Node.js (current)
  1. We wanted to use the newsest version of Node.js. This way we can use the most up to date documentation
  (information from 2. and below comes from https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V11.md#11.9.0)
  2. OpenSSL has been updated to 1.1.1a, which is API/ABI compatible with the previous OpenSSL 1.1.0j. Note that while OpenSSL 1.1.1a supports TLS1.3, Node.js still does not. #25381)
